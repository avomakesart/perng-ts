# PERNG-TS
Postgres, Express, React, Node, Graphql and Typescript boilerplate.

## Backend usage

Clone the repo and then go to the server folder, inside the server folder you should do `yarn install` to install all the dependencies.

```bash
Type 'yarn install' on your terminal
```

## Usage

```bash
"Dev scripts": To run in a dev environment you should do: 'yarn dev'
```

## Instalations

You should have a postgres database running and a redis server running as well in order to have the backend fully working.
